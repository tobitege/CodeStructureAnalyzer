# CSA 0.2.1 Release Notes (Draft)

Date: 2026-02-18

## Summary

This patch release stabilizes install-time and runtime behavior, especially for packaged installs, CLI host configuration, and provider error handling.

## Highlights

- Fixed wheel packaging to include all `csa` subpackages (including `csa.reporters` and `csa.retrieval`).
- Unified versioning to `0.2.1` across package metadata and runtime version.
- Fixed relative output path resolution to use current working directory instead of package install directory.
- Removed stale exception-class handling path in CLI by eliminating module reload coupling.
- Clarified and enforced host precedence:
  - provider-specific host flags win,
  - legacy `--llm-host` is fallback-only.
- Replaced `sys.exit(1)` in LM Studio provider library code with typed exceptions.
- Removed fragile mutation of private `concurrent.futures` internals.
- Removed global socket timeout side effects in CLI reachability checks.
- Reduced analyzer chunk-read overhead by reusing preloaded file lines.
- Fixed Mermaid dependency graph collisions for duplicate basenames in different folders.

## Test and Verification

- Non-integration tests: `46 passed, 2 deselected`.
- Added packaging smoke test for wheel build/install/import and CLI help.
- Added regression tests for:
  - host precedence,
  - provider-specific error routing,
  - output path location/writeability,
  - LM Studio typed error propagation,
  - analyzer preloaded chunk reads,
  - Mermaid duplicate-basename handling.

## Notes

- README was updated to reflect host precedence and output path behavior.
